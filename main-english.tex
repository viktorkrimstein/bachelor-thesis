	\section*{Abstract}
	
		In the context of Industry 4.0, services are brought to the forefront along with a higher degree of networking. 
		The vision of self-governing systems that exchange information and make decisions without human intervention is a primary goal, but not necessarily the focus of many projects. 
		
		The research project ``Rent'n'Produce: Secure Cloud Service for the Commissioning and Control of Production Systems'' which is currently being processed at the Institute for Control Engineering of Machine Tools and Manufacturing Units of the University of Stuttgart, has the vision of advancing self-directed manufacturing systems. 
		Companies from different industries should be provided with a cloud-based platform that enables a highly flexible production order. 
		
		This bachelor thesis will focus on the integration of a real machine tool into the Rent'n'Produce Cloud Platform by using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture. 
		The required functionality of the integrated service should be encapsulated in a virtualization container. 
		This middleware is intended to provide access to configuration and status data of the production resource, to transfer numerical control programs to the machine tool, and to start or stop the part production.

		Unternehmen unterschiedlicher Branchen soll eine cloudbasierte Plattform zu Verfügung gestellt werden, mit der eine hochflexible Fertigungsbeauftragung möglich ist, ebenso wie der administrative Zugriff auf Produktionsressourcen.
		
		Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Anbindung einer realen Werkzeugmaschine basierend auf der Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture an Rent'n'Produce umzusetzen. 
		Die benötigte Funktionalität der Anbindung soll dabei in einem Virtualisierungscontainer gekapselt werden. 
		Diese Middleware soll den Zugriff auf Konfigurations- und Zustandsdaten der Produktionsressource, die Übertragung von Programmen für numerische Steuerungen auf die Maschine und das Starten wie Stoppen der Bearbeitung ermöglichen.

	\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}
		
		The trend of connecting physical objects with the Internet gave birth to the term \gls{iot}. 
		\gls{iot} envisions applications running with interconnected objects working together to gather data and act in environments by controlling different actuators to enable new functionality with minimal human intervention~\cite{atzori2010internet}.
		With the introduction of \gls{iot} and \gls{cps} concepts in industrial application scenarios, automation is undergoing a tremendous change~\cite{wollschlaeger2017future}.
		By adapting these concepts, the philosophy of ``\gls{dama}'' has emerged in the past decade~\cite{heinrichs2005anywhere,venkatesh2005validating,manenti2011building}. 
		The \gls{dama} approach demands the ability to exchange design and manufacturing data across multiple sites. 
		\gls{dama} also helps establish links between \gls{mrp}, \gls{erp} and \gls{crm}~\cite{xu2012cloud}. 
		
		However, today's networked manufacturing mainly refers to integration of distributed resources for undertaking a single manufacturing task~\cite{li2010cloud}.
		What is lacking in this type of manufacturing regime are the centralized operation management of the services, choice of different operation modes and embedded access of manufacturing equipment and resources, without which a seamless, stable and high quality transaction of manufacturing resource services and a \gls{qos} cannot be guaranteed~\cite{tao2010theory}.
		Further, any attempt to steer processes independently of continuous human interaction requires, in a very wide sense, the flow of information between some kind of sensors, controllers, and actuators ~\cite{sauter2011evolution}.
		
		The vision to drive self-optimizing production systems forward and to manage them through a cloud platform is an important aspect of \gls{cm} but has not been the focus of many research projects. 
		With the research project \gls{rnp}~\cite{ellwein2016} which is currently being processed at the \gls{isw}, and its available functionalities at the time of writing this thesis, manufacturers of different industries and sectors can use the cloud platform for flexible production assignment and detailed order management. 
		To drive the vision forward, \gls{rnp} aims to integrate features and functionalities to access machine tools directly from the cloud and independently of their physical location and the underlying manufacturing platforms by only relying on a homogeneous \gls{m2m} communication.
		
		Unfortunately, the last requirement is quite a difficult one as manufacturers show a huge heterogeneity in the ways and protocols, the machine tools support for communication and data access~\cite{xu2012cloud}.
		Tackling this challenge two specifications emerged within the last years.
		European manufacturers integrated the \gls{opcua} the extension of its predecessor \gls{opc}, while in the United States \gls{dds} gets more popular~\cite{niggemann2015data}.
		
		\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
		
			\gls{cm} is a concept which aims to transform the traditional manufacturing process into the cloud and enable users of the platform an intelligent and more comfortable way to manage manufacturing resources and production assignment~\cite{xu2012cloud}. 
			The realization of a shared resource pool, such as shared manufacturing resources and capabilities, and on-demand use of manufacturing services provide users the ability to manage and view resources at any time or place~\cite{tao2011cloud}. 
			It is possible to follow the whole manufacturing process from the designing stage to production and manufacturing companies can scale their production according to the clients' demand~\cite{tao2011cloud}. 
			The motivation of this work is to provide an architectural approach to provision and manage machine tools of manufacturers remotely and to transfer production data down to the machines using an \gls{m2m} standard communication protocol.
			
			In the scope of this work, production data will be represented in form of G-Code.
			G-Code is the term for a programming language that is used to control automated machine tools~\cite{shin2007reincarnation}. 
			It is a industry standard and often referred to as ISO-6983. 
			Each line of G-Code is executed sequentially and contains information for the machine tool on how to perform a specific task.
			
			By integrating this architecture to \gls{rnp} clients would be given the possibility to track, manage and control their machine tools remotely over a cloud platform independent of their local automation infrastructure.
		
		\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}
			
			The goal of this thesis is to model the integration of a real machine tool into the \gls{rnp} cloud platform by using \gls{opcua}.
			Therefore, use-cases will be researched and evaluated to create an architecture, modeling the specified requirements.
			This architecture will be later on tested, using a prototypical implementation of a \gls{poc}. 
			The required functionality of the integrated \gls{poc} should be encapsulated in a virtualization container. 
			This middleware is intended to provide access to configuration and status data of the production resource, to transfer \gls{nc} programs, generated through a \gls{cad} and \gls{cam} process chain, to the machine tool, and to start or stop the part production. The resulting \gls{poc} should simulate the \gls{cm} processes beginning with the order management and ending with the production of a real part.
			Subgoals are defined as follows:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Evaluation and specification of an architecture providing the required functionality.
				
				\item Implementing and integrating a \gls{poc} service based on the developed architecture.
				
				\item The \gls{poc} should be able to store G-Code for the production part description.
				
				\item The \gls{poc} should provide its functionality using  an \gls{api}.
				
				\item Integration of a real milling machine to the \gls{rnp} platform using the \gls{poc}.
				
			\end{itemize}
			
	\newpage
			
		\section{Structure}
		
			This thesis is structured as follows: In \Cref{ch:foundations}, we describe in detail the scope and the research field of this work. 
			Furthermore we provide relations to the \gls{rnp} research project and to the field of \gls{cm}.
			References to the current state of the art are presented in \Cref{ch:state_of_the_art}.
			Afterwards we take a differentiated view on the present state of the research in \Cref{ch:state_of_the_Science}.
			Concepts and methodologies of the \gls{poc} to be developed as part this work are discussed in more detail in \Cref{ch:concept}.
			In \Cref{ch:discusion} we discuss the results of the \gls{poc} implementation.
			\Cref{ch:conclusion_and_outlook} concludes the paper and outlines possible future work.

		\section{Rent'n'Produce}\label{sec:rent_n_produce}
		
			The research project \gls{rnp} of the \gls{isw} draws on the existing infrastructure and networking in manufacturing companies and relies on a cloud-based platform for the commissioning of machine-tools and equipment~\cite{xen.17b}. The declared goal of the research project is a highly flexible, location-independent production order across company boundaries. The production parts' description required for commissioning can be present in the form of \gls{cad} data or \gls{nc} programs and transmitted to the system by the client. 
			The provided functionality of the \gls{rnp} platform at the beginning of this work is as show in \Cref{fig:rnp_workflow}.
			
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rnp_workflow.jpg}
				\caption{The workflow of the R'n'P platform.}
				\label{fig:rnp_workflow}
			\end{figure}
			
			Before commissioning the selected resource at the shop floor level, the production part descriptions have to go through a postprocessor and then to be adapted to the selected production resource from the resource catalog.
			This thesis deals with the transfer of existing G-Code data to a production resource. 
			The postprocessing of workpiece descriptions is part of a parallel research project.
			
			\subsection{Initial Architecture}\label{subsec:initial_architecture}
			
			The architecture is based on several services which work independently of each other following a \gls{soa} approach~\cite{erl2008soa}. 
			Each service is split up in a persistence layer and a business logic layer making its functionality accessible to other services using an \gls{api}.
			A simplified view on the architecture of \gls{rnp} is shown in \Cref{fig:rnp_architecture}.
			
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rnp_components_simplified.jpg}
				\caption{Simplified architecture of the Rent'n'Produce platform.}
				\label{fig:rnp_architecture}
			\end{figure}
			
			Further, every service is responsible only for one specific part of the whole platform domain(e.g., order management, user access and permission management etc.).
			Through the serverd database interface, the business logic can access the persistence layer to store and retrieve data required for domain specific operations.
			The business logic layer itself, contains all functionality provided by the platform encapsulated to different services.
			
			Services and databases are encapsulated in virtualization containers to ensure platform independence and the increase of maintainability~\cite{xen.17b}. 
			The web interface component is the application layer which contains the \gls{ui} and the \gls{api} gateway routing all client requests to the appropriate services by its internal \gls{url} representation. 
			
		\section{Cloud Computing}\label{sec:cloud_computing}
		
			By the \gls{nist} definition of cloud computing, cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction~\cite{mell2011nist}.
			This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment
			models~\cite{fehling2014cloud}. With regard to this work, we will focus and describe the three service models, often adapted in the manufacturing environment.
			
			\paragraph{\gls{saas}} The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure~\cite{mell2011nist}.\footnote{A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer~\cite{fehling2014cloud}. The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.}
			The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface~\cite{mell2011nist}. 
			The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited userspecific application configuration settings~\cite{mell2011nist}.
			
			\paragraph{\gls{paas}} The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider~\cite{fehling2014cloud}.\footnote{This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from other sources.}
			The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
			
			\paragraph{\gls{iaas}} The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications~\cite{leymann2011cloud}. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)~\cite{mell2011nist}.
			
			As shown in \cref{sec:rent_n_produce}, the \gls{rnp} cloud platform is built upon a \gls{iaas} layer providing its functionality over the \gls{paas} and \gls{saas} models. The goals and motivations of this work, can be related to the \gls{paas} model, as machin-tools and manufacturing sites should be provisioned over the services provided by the platform.

		\section{Cloud Manufacturing}\label{sec:cloud_manufacturing}
		
			\gls{cm} is a networked manufacturing paradigm which has emerged due to the introduction of cloud computing concepts and technologies, such as resource pooling, virtualization, \gls{soa} and the concepts described in \cref{sec:cloud_computing}~\cite{macia2012cloud}. 
			It refers to the distribution of manufacturing resources via the internet and allow users access to manufacturing services in a flexible and location independent (only limited by the real-time connectivity required) way, using a \gls{xaas} payment model only for the time resource are occupied~\cite{macia2012cloud}.
			
			Services offered to the manufactures range from product design and development to manufacturing production of the requested parts~\cite{xu2012cloud}. The provided resources  are managed and encapsulated in a centralized way through the whole automation pyramid~\cite{kleinemeier2014automatisierungspyramide}.
			In a \gls{cm} system, three types of users and roles are defined -- providers, consumers and operators~\cite{wu2013cloud}.
			
			Providers offer manufacturing resources on the platform. 
			They can take the form of a single person, a whole organization or a third party~\cite{tao2014cciot}. 
			Consumers are users who subscribe to manufacturing services offered by the platform and pay for the usage time~\cite{he2015state}. 
			The responsibility of operators is to operate the platform to deliver services which can be used by providers and consumers.
			The operator is also responsible to maintain the technologies and service stack involved within the platform as well as the platform architecture and design~\cite{tedeschi2015security}.
			
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cloud_manufacturing.jpg}
				\caption{Architecture of a cloud manufacturing system adapted from~\cite{xu2012cloud}.}
				\label{fig:cloud_manufacturing}
			\end{figure}
		
			The architecture of a \gls{cm} platform shown in \cref{fig:cloud_manufacturing} is constructed by the following four tiers and three domains: the manufacturing resource layer, virtual service layer, global service layer and the application layer~\cite{wu2013cloud}.
			In the manufacturing resource layer, resources which are required for the product life cycle of the production, including machine-tools, gateways and administration tools, are provided. 
			Resources can either be physical resources or machine-tools in general, as well as abstracted manufacturing capabilities~\cite{kleinemeier2014automatisierungspyramide}. 
			Manufacturing resources include for instance equipment, servers or \gls{plc} units~\cite{xu2012cloud}. 
			With abstract manufacturing capabilities, producers and manufacturer offer the possibility for executing a special task and can include the cycles of product design and development, production, control and so on~\cite{he2015state}.
			
			With the virtual service layer, manufacturing resources are identified, abstracted, virtualized and offered as \gls{cm} services. tedeschi2015security
			Further, these \gls{cm} services are offered to customers relying on the platform and can be paid by its users on demand~\cite{tedeschi2015security}.
			The global service layer relies on cloud deployment technologies which are necessary to run the system and bridges the provider and customer domains.
			Cloud deployment technologies can be for instance an \gls{iaas} or a \gls{paas} offering, as described in~\cref{sec:cloud_computing}. 
			The global service layer can operate in two operation modes -- complete service mode and partial service mode. 
			The complete service mode orchestrates all manufacturing processes itself~\cite{xu2012cloud}.
			In the partial service mode, it is possible for providers to take control over the processes at system scope where the global service layer supports the management and oraganization of these processes. 
			Finally, the application layer is responsible for the interaction between the end-user and the manufacturing resources~\cite{xu2012cloud}. 
		
		\section{OPC UA} \label{sec:opc_ua}
		
			The \gls{opcua} is the new version of the well-known \gls{opc} architecture originally designed by the \gls{opc} Foundation to
			connect industrial devices to control and supervision applications~\cite{hadlich2006providing}. The focus of \gls{opc} is on getting access to large amounts of real-time data while ensuring performance constraints without disrupting the normal operation of the devices~\cite{candido2010soa}.
			The original \gls{opc} specifications, based on Microsofts \gls{com}, are becoming obsolete and are gradually being replaced by new interoperability standards, including web-services what led the \gls{opc} Foundation to publish a new architecture, called \gls{opcua}~\cite{hadlich2006providing}.
			
			\subsection{Server Model}\label{subsec:opc_ua_server_model}
			
				\gls{opcua} specifies the exchange of real-time information of production plant data between control devices or \gls{it} systems from different manufacturers~\cite{venkatesh2005validating}.
				The communication is established by a \textit{inverted} client-server system, where the client triggers actions on the server for automation control, and the server executes the commands on, or retrieves data from the underlying machine~\cite{imtiaz2013scalability}.
				\gls{opcua} server include an information model that allows users to organize data and their semantics in a structured manner. 
				The information model constitutes the address spaces of \gls{opcua} servers. 
				It is a fullmesh network of nodes with their properties and relations.
				In general, users create the information model for their \gls{opcua} servers manually at implementation time or implement vendor-specific automatisms~\cite{henssen2014online}.
				A server address space consists of the following element types which are shown in \Cref{fig:opc_ua_server_model}.
				
				\begin{itemize}
					
					\item \textit{Object}: ``A \textit{Node} that represents a physical or abstract element of a system. Objects are modelled using the \gls{opcua} \textit{Object Model}. Systems, subsystems and devices are examples of Objects. An Object may be defined as an instance of an ObjectType.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
					\item \textit{ObjectType}: ``A Node that represents the type definition
					for an Object.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
					\item \textit{Variable}: ``A Variable is a Node that contains a value.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
					\item \textit{VariableType}: ``Node that represents the type definition for a Variable`'~\cite{opcfoundation2018part3}
					
					\item \textit{DataType}: ``An instance of a DataType Node that is used together with the \textit{ValueRank} attribute to define the data type of a Variable.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2018part3}
					
					\item \textit{ReferenceType}: ``A Node that represents the type definition of a \textit{Reference}. The ReferenceType specifies the semantics of a Reference. The name of a ReferenceType identifies how source Nodes are related to target Nodes and generally reflects an operation between the two, such as “A Contains B”.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
					\item \textit{Method}: ``A callable software function that is a component of an Object.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
					\item \textit{View}: ``A specific subset of the \textit{AddressSpace} that is of interest to the \textit{Client}.`'~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}
					
				\end{itemize}
			
				\begin{figure}[htbp]
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{opc_ua_server_model.jpg}
					\caption{The \gls{opcua} server architecture adapted from~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}.}
					\label{fig:opc_ua_server_model}
				\end{figure}
		
			\subsection{OPC UA Client Model}\label{subsec:opc_ua_client_model}
		
				The \gls{opcua} Client architecture models the Client endpoint of client/server interactions. \Cref{fig:opc_ua_client_model} illustrates the major elements of a typical Client and how they relate to each other.
		
				\begin{figure}[htbp]
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{opc_ua_client_model.jpg}
					\caption{The \gls{opcua} client architecture adapted from~\cite{opcfoundation2017part1}.}
					\label{fig:opc_ua_client_model}
				\end{figure}
			
				The Client Application is the code that implements the function of the Client. 
				It uses the Client \gls{api} to send and receive \gls{opcua} Service requests and responses to the Server. 
				The Services defined for \gls{opcua} are described in Clause 6.4 of~\cite{opcfoundation2017part4}.
				Note that the ``Client API`' is an internal interface that isolates the Client application code from an \gls{opcua} Communication Stack. 
				The \gls{opcua} Communication Stack converts Client \gls{api} calls into Messages and sends them through the underlying communications entity to the Server at the request of the Client application. 
				The \gls{opcua} Communication Stack also receives response and \textit{NotificationMessages} from the underlying communications entity and delivers them to the Client application through the Client \gls{api}.

	\chapter{Concept} \label{ch:concept}
	
		In this chapter, we will describe our concept for the \gls{poc} to be integrated to \gls{rnp}.
		\Cref{sec:requirements} discusses and list requirements for the infrastructure and architecture of the platform, the technology decisions taken for the \gls{poc} implementation as well as mandatory and optional features. In \Cref{sec:approach} we will highlight the implementation approach of the \gls{poc} highlighting the way we integrated the service into the platform. 
		
		\section{Requirements} \label{sec:requirements}
		
			In this section, we will summarize and give an overview over the requirements, gathered from the analysis of the \gls{rnp} platform and the discussion with the research partners.
		
			\subsection{Infrastructure} \label{subsec:infrastructure}
			
				In \Cref{sec:rent_n_produce} we described, that the \gls{rnp} platform is built upon services following the \gls{soa} approach, where each of the services takes responsibility for one specific domain task.
				Further, every service is seperated into a business logic component serving the \gls{api} for its functionality, and a persistence layer component implemented either as a \gls{sql} or \gls{nosql} database.
				Following this pattern, we deduce that the requirement will be to implement the \gls{poc} as a service, which stores the machine-tool configuration data as well as the G-Code for the production part in a database and serves its \gls{api} over a service layer compoenent.
				Further, both components will be realized using Docker containers.
				The business logic container will register itself to the service discovery component and be routable over the \gls{api} gateway.
			
			\subsection{Architecture} \label{subsec:architecture}
			
				As shown in \Cref{subsec:infrastructure} the \gls{poc} to be realized will be packaged into a Docker container and its functionality will be split up into a persistence layer and a business logic layer.
				As the machine-tool integration represents a part of the resource service process, it doesn't need a \gls{ui} integration, as this part is already implemented in the \gls{rnp} architecture.
				
				More precise -- the \gls{poc} should implement an \gls{api}, which can be requested from the resource service, to trigger the production of the required parts contained in a customer order.
			
			\subsection{Technology} \label{subsec:technology}
			
				A core requirement to the \gls{poc} is the support of the \gls{opcua} protocol.
				Over \gls{opcua} the \gls{poc} should communicate with the machine-tools already registered in the resource service of the platform.
				Second requirement is the filtering and recognition of G-Code data as it will be transfered to the \gls{plc} of the machine-tool.
				For the integration to \gls{rnp}, the service should support the communication of \gls{json} over \gls{http} as well as the interaction with the service discovery server and the \gls{api} gateway.
